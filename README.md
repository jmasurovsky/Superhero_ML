# Superhero_ML

## Project Topic

This machine learning project will focus on the topic of comic book characters, with the majority of them being superheroes. I chose this topic because I thoroughly enjoy reading comic books and graphic novels, especially as a kid.  Comic books and superheroes from Marvel and DC publishers have been around since the 1930s. In the past decade, The DC and Marvel universe has exploded into the film and tv industry even more so than it had before. Only in recent years, datasets have been created for public use about Marvel and DC character abilites and physical characteristics, which have impacted an emergence of using data analytic and visualization methodologies on the datasets. Datasets for this project was found on Kaggle, a data science community website that hosts wide range of datasets and tooltips. 

Research questions that will be explored in this project are:

- Can we classify a superhero as good or evil based off their physical characteristics and abilities?
- Can we cluster superheroes by their abilities to uncover similarities between good and evil characters?
- Which superhero abilities have statistically significant influence on one another?

## Technologies Used

### Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn packages will be used to clean, explore, and visualize the data. Python will be used to conduct further analysis.

### Database Storage
PostgreSQL will be used as database storage and will integrate with Python and possibly JavaScript for dashboard integration.

### Machine Learning
Python's ScikitLearn package will be used to perform machine learning methodologies. R studio will be used to perform multi-linear regressions.

### Dashboard
JavaScript's D3.js library will be used to create an interactive dashboard.


## ML Model(s)

To answer the first research question, classification model(s) will be used such as logistic regression, SVM, Naive Bayes, and/or decision trees. The target variables will be the "Alignment" field, which contains values of 'good' and 'bad' represented as '1' and '0'. Below is a sample output from a logistic regression performed on the data.
